When the waterfall rises

Scrolling and swiping are not tools to neither briefly nor comprehensively digest the flood of information on the Web.
While scrolling and swiping your eyes are doing lot of work for you.
They are trying to capture any intresting, because you are most probably curious.
They are trying to filter relevant information, because you are most probably searching.
Your eyes are most probably used to that behaviour, because you do not know anything else.

More and more websites pretending to be user-friendly, innovative and serving only useful content.
And you know, that is total bullshit.
Amazon hides it logout-button on an unexpected position in a drop-down (or fly-out) menu.
Twitter does the same.
They are all following the same trend, namely user-un-friendliness.

The often quoted phrase „Don't let me think“ might be a tremendious game changer in re-thinking design, but this might let us into a dead end.
The sofware, and I mean websites and apps also, we are using day to day is broken.
And ethical design migth hold the answer.
Aral Balkan paved the way for us.
Give it a fly-by-read, it is very short and join our way back to benevolent and individual software development.

I kept my problem description very briefly in favor to focus on a simple design solution, which might have the power to change at least a tiny thing in the world wide web.
It is better to invest my energy that brings some advantage on high probablity instead of invest lots of time in projects that will change whole sophisticated ecosystems on high cost and less probability of finite realisation.

## Technology does not solve any social problems, but technical ones

After hearing a series of super-scientific talks on how to overcome obstacles that hinder the actual work, I am done. I have seen everything, that I wanted to see. The work is done. It is cute to see some individiuals promoting there little pieces of software that can run on high performance machines, that are only accessable from university networks or similiar institutions, that can gather hunders of processors and hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.

Why are you calling your software open? It is open, yes, to a biased and homogeneous slice of the society. Yes, it is open, if you can read the codes^[Social codes as well as source codes]. It is a biased rather one-dimensional particular part of humanes. You have to be at least a student^[xx% of German Society 2018 is right now studiying, xx% of German Society has studied and carries a degree, xx% of German Society intends to achieve 2018 (Gymnasiasten, Abendschule, Berufsschule etc.)] It is homogeneous, because most attending people on conferences are white, male,harmless and nice humans.

## Code Design Sucks 
> After hearing from high performance computer system's programmers having to be tought stuff like [git](Revision control manages changes to a set of data over time.), CI and modern programming standards, I am not sure, if I still want Research and Progress to increase and accelerate. It is not about the fact, that highly educated people are not motivated to follow a so called defacto standard and best practise. No, it is not about that. I am concerned about their ignorance. We are surrounded by mass-aplicable technologies that mostly fit one function. Everything becomes technology, but anything remains.

In Design mostly everybody heard about «Form follows Function» proposition. But what does that actually mean? Do my Thoughts regarding the Functions, Features and Purposes come after the Form is established when I am developing a new Product?
