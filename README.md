## Cartographing the internet

Recieve unique data bei a minimum of input (short search terms).

## Technology does not solve any social problems, but technical ones

After hearing a series of super-scientific talks on how to overcome obstacles that hinder the actual work, I am done. I have seen everything, that I wanted to see. The work is done. It is cute to see some individiuals promoting there little pieces of software that can run on high performance machines, that are only accessable from university networks or similiar institutions, that can gather hunders of processors and hundreds of gigabytes of RAM.

Why are you calling your software open? It is open, yes, to a biased and homogeneous slice of the society. Yes, it is open, if you can read the codes^[Social codes as well as source codes]. It is a biased rather one-dimensional particular part of humanes. You have to be at least a student^[xx% of German Society 2018 is right now studiying, xx% of German Society has studied and carries a degree, xx% of German Society intends to achieve 2018 (Gymnasiasten, Abendschule, Berufsschule etc.)] It is homogeneous, because most attending people on conferences are white, male,harmless and nice humans.

## Code Design Sucks 
> After hearing from high performance computer system's programmers having to be tought stuff like [git](Revision control manages changes to a set of data over time.), CI and modern programming standards, I am not sure, if I still want Research and Progress to increase and accelerate. It is not about the fact, that highly educated people are not motivated to follow a so called defacto standard and best practise. No, it is not about that. I am concerned about their ignorance. We are surrounded by mass-aplicable technologies that mostly fit one function. Everything becomes technology, but anything remains.

In Design mostly everybody heard about «Form follows Function» proposition. But what does that actually mean? Do my Thoughts regarding the Functions, Features and Purposes come after the Form is established when I am developing a new Product?
